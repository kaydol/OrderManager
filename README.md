# OrderManager

Pizzeria “Venice” prepares delicious pizzas and appreciates every customer. Especially for regular customers, it was decided to add the possibility of paying for the orders with a maximum delay of one week. During the week, the customer can order and receive pizza any number of times, and pay, for example, with a one-time payment at the end of the week. If the payment was not received for more than a week, the possibility of ordering is blocked until the debt is paid.
